# Micro-Reddit
## Building with Active Record

> This project aims to test our knowledge of active records, models and associations. We built a simple ```User-Post-Comment``` model pattern like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). Hence the name of the project. 

> a ```User``` is created, who's able to create a ```Post```, and other ```User```s can ```Comment``` on the ```Post```. [Read this for full description.](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record-ruby-on-rails)
